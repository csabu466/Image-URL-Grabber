### Image URL Grabber Firefox Extension

The **Image URL Grabber** extension allows users to quickly gather all image URLs from the current webpage and copy them to the clipboard. It supports both standard `<img>` elements and images loaded through CSS as `background-images`. Additionally, it handles lazy-loaded images, which may not have their `src` attribute set immediately.

#### Key Features:
- **Grabs All Image URLs**: Collects URLs from `<img>` tags and background images in the page's CSS.
- **Handles Lazy-Loaded Images**: Extracts URLs from images that use `data-src` or similar lazy-loading attributes.
- **Copy to Clipboard**: All valid image URLs are copied to the clipboard with a single click.
- **User Notifications**: Provides success, error, or no-image-found feedback using Firefox notifications.

This extension is useful for developers, designers, or anyone needing to quickly access or download images from a webpage.
